# *About the Collection*

This site hosts a digitized collection of bookmarks from independent bookstores sourced from Erin Walden's collection of bookmarks (learn more about me on the [contributor page](https://erinwalden.github.io/bookmarked/contributors.html). The bookstores represented here are primarily located in the United States, though some have been sourced from around the world with the help of my friends and family. This project follows the [Library of Congress Technical Standards for Digital Conversion of Text and Graphic Materials](https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/about/techStandards.pdf) and implements rich metadata to create a functional and user-friendly browsing experience.

Since 2016, the year that I started my undergraduate education, I have been collecting bookmarks. The bookstores represented here follow the trajectory of my life, starting in Providence, RI, moving occasionally through New York City, Long Island, and Massachusetts, and slowly creeping toward the Midwest through Philadelphia and Ohio.

You will see souvenirs from trips to Portland, Oregon to visit my cousins and road trips back-and-forth from the East Coast to Indiana. My larger personal collection includes bookmarks from various cultural institutions and small presses, including the [Shofuso Japanese Cultural Center](https://japanphilly.org/shofuso/) in Philadelphia and [*Fortune*](https://printingfortunes.info/) a Philadelphia-based print collective assembled by/for queer and trans Asians. For this project, I have decided to include only bookmarks from independent bookstores.

An independent bookstore is extactly what it sounds like: an independently-owned bookstore. Most only have a single location, though several here have multiple locations (such as[McNally Jackson](https://erinwalden.github.io/bookmarked/item.html?id=bookmark007) and [Powell's Books](https://erinwalden.github.io/bookmarked/item.html?id=bookmark024), among others). With the rise of shopping malls in the 1950s, mall-based bookstore chains proliferated and underwent a major expansions in the 1970s and 1980s. With the rise of e-books and websites like Amazon in the 2000s, independent bookstore underwent a decline. However, according to [Paddy Hrisch of NPR](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/29/598053563/why-the-number-of-independent-bookstores-increased-during-the-retail-apocalypse), "between 2009 and 2015, the number of independent bookstores grew by 35 percent. This happened during the so-called 'retail apocalypse,' which has pitted Amazon against every retail outlet in America." Today, the independent bookstore industry is still booming, with more than  300 bookstores have opened in the past couple of years, according to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/10/books/bookstores-diversity-pandemic.html).

I am extremely grateful to friends and family who have gifted bookmarks to me throughout the years. You can learn more about these contributors on the [**Contributor Page**](https://erinwalden.github.io/bookmarked/contributors.html).

This project was created for [Z652: Digital Libraries](https://jawalsh.github.io/z652-Digital-Libraries-FA23/) with Professor [John Walsh](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/jawalsh/) and [Alex Wingate](https://alexandraewingate.com/).

# *Bookmark Collecting*

There is a rich history of [bookmark collecting](https://www.biblio.com/book-collecting/what-to-collect/ephemera/bookmarks/), especially in the book collecting world. Bookmarks can offer an accessible entry point into collecting as they are often free or low-cost and require little space to store. I hope that this website can be viewed alongside resources such as the Instagram account [@bookstoremark](https://www.instagram.com/bookstoremark/) and numerous blogs, some of which discuss [vintage](https://adirondackgirlatheart.com/bookmark-collecting-guide/), [travel](https://danisbookshelf.com/2018/04/14/my-travel-bookmark-collection/), and [Halloween](https://www.ifobookmarks.org/blog/category/collecting-bookmarks) bookmarks (among other topics). Those interested in more information about bookmark collecting can look to [The International Friends of Bookmarks](https://www.ifobookmarks.org/bookmark-swap.html) website. I hope that this project can be utilized by book lovers, booksellers, designers, and those interested in paper and material culture.

# *Technical Details*

Bookmarks in the collection are contained in single image JPEG or PNG files. When a bookmark had two sides, I scanned each side separately and used InDesign to put them into one file. All photos *other than bookmarks* are hosted on my [personal Are.na account](https://www.are.na/erin-lee-walden/bookmarks-7hitlyaje5i). I hope that hosting the images on an additional platform can increase the exposure and reach of this site.
